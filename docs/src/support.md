# Support Status

This library aims to enable users to calculate the value of integrals over all
[**Meshes.jl**](https://github.com/JuliaGeometry/Meshes.jl) geometry types using
a number of numerical integration rules and techniques. However, some combinations
of geometry types and integration rules are ill-suited (and a few are simply not
yet implemented).

## General Recommendations

In general, `GaussKronrod` integration rules are recommended (and the default) for
geometries with one parametric dimension. For geometries with more than one
parametric dimension, e.g. surfaces and volumes, `HAdaptiveCubature` rules are
recommended (and the default).

While it is currently possible to apply nested `GaussKronrod` rules to numerically
integrate surfaces, this produces results that are strictly inferior to using an
equivalent `HAdaptiveCubature` rule, so support for this usage has been deprecated.
In version 16.x of MeshIntegrals.jl, using a `GaussKronrod` rule for a surface
will work but will yield a deprecation warning. Beginning with a future version
17.0, this combination will simply be unsupported and throw an error.

## The Support Matrix

The following Support Matrix captures the current state of support for all geometry/rule
combinations. Entries with a green check mark are fully supported and pass unit tests
designed to check for accuracy.
